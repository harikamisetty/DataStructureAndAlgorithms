 * You are given a list of integers votes representing election votes for candidates a and b. Each element in votes represents a vote to one of the two candidates:

If votes[i] < 0, then it's a vote for a.
If votes[i] â‰¥ n, then it's a vote for b.
Otherwise, the vote at index i made the same vote as votes[votes[i]].
Return the number of votes that candidate a received. You can assume all votes are eventually made to either a or b.
